  "reasoning": "The model response indicates multiple errors in the workbook, while the golden answer states 'No Error'. Since the model response contradicts the golden answer by identifying errors that do not exist, it fails to capture the accuracy of the golden answer. Therefore, the score reflects that no errors were correctly identified according to the golden answer.",

Error Cell(s): Example, D41

Error Type: formula inclusion error

Error Explanation: The cash balance formula includes an arbitrary addition of 100 that has no business justification. The formula "=183815.256583009+(100)" adds 100 to what should be the calculated cash flow balance.

Error Fix: Remove the "+100" component so the formula becomes "=183815.256583009" or link to the proper cash flow calculation.

Error Cell(s): Example, I80

Error Type: dependency error

Error Explanation: The closing cash balance cell I80 has no dependents (deps=2→0) when it should link to the balance sheet cash position I41, creating a broken cash flow to balance sheet linkage.

Error Fix: Ensure I80 properly links to I41 by adding I80 as a precedent to I41.

Error Cell(s): Example, K80

Error Type: dependency error

Error Explanation: The closing cash balance cell K80 has no dependents (deps=2→0) when it should link to the balance sheet cash position K41, creating a broken cash flow to balance sheet linkage.

Error Fix: Ensure K80 properly links to K41 by adding K80 as a precedent to K41.

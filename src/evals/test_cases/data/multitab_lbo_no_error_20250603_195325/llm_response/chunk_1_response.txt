Error Cell(s): Assumptions, B12

Error Type: Formula inclusion error

Error Explanation: Cell B12 contains the formula "=$C$2" which references the case selector, but this cell should contain a hardcoded value of 1 to indicate it's the first assumption row. The CHOOSE functions in row 13 are correctly referencing B12, but B12 itself should not be dynamically linked to the case selector.

Error Fix: Change B12 from "=$C$2" to hardcoded value 1

Error Cell(s): Assumptions, B20

Error Type: Formula inclusion error  

Error Explanation: Cell B20 contains the formula "=$C$2" which references the case selector, but this cell should contain a hardcoded value of 1 to indicate it's the first assumption row. The CHOOSE functions in row 21 are correctly referencing B20, but B20 itself should not be dynamically linked to the case selector.

Error Fix: Change B20 from "=$C$2" to hardcoded value 1

Error Cell(s): Assumptions, B28

Error Type: Formula inclusion error

Error Explanation: Cell B28 contains the formula "=$C$2" which references the case selector, but this cell should contain a hardcoded value of 1 to indicate it's the first assumption row. The CHOOSE functions in row 29 are correctly referencing B28, but B28 itself should not be dynamically linked to the case selector.

Error Fix: Change B28 from "=$C$2" to hardcoded value 1

Error Cell(s): Assumptions, B36

Error Type: Formula inclusion error

Error Explanation: Cell B36 contains the formula "=$C$2" which references the case selector, but this cell should contain a hardcoded value of 1 to indicate it's the first assumption row. The CHOOSE functions in row 37 are correctly referencing B36, but B36 itself should not be dynamically linked to the case selector.

Error Fix: Change B36 from "=$C$2" to hardcoded value 1

Error Cell(s): Assumptions, B44

Error Type: Formula inclusion error

Error Explanation: Cell B44 contains the formula "=$C$2" which references the case selector, but this cell should contain a hardcoded value of 1 to indicate it's the first assumption row. The CHOOSE functions in row 45 are correctly referencing B44, but B44 itself should not be dynamically linked to the case selector.

Error Fix: Change B44 from "=$C$2" to hardcoded value 1

Error Cell(s): Assumptions, B52

Error Type: Formula inclusion error

Error Explanation: Cell B52 contains the formula "=$C$2" which references the case selector, but this cell should contain a hardcoded value of 1 to indicate it's the first assumption row. The CHOOSE functions in row 53 are correctly referencing B52, but B52 itself should not be dynamically linked to the case selector.

Error Fix: Change B52 from "=$C$2" to hardcoded value 1

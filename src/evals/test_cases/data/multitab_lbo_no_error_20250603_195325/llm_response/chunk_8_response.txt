Error Cell(s): PPE Schedule, C5

Error Type: Formula inclusion error

Error Explanation: The opening balance formula in C5 incorrectly includes depreciation (C8) and additions (C6) in the calculation. The opening balance should be a hardcoded value for the first year, not calculated from other components.

Error Fix: Replace formula =+C9-C8-C6 with hardcoded value 5.915

Error Cell(s): Debt Schedule, C7

Error Type: Incorrect cell reference

Error Explanation: The repayment formula in C7 references D7 (=+D7), creating a circular dependency where C7 depends on D7, but D7's formula also depends on debt balances. The first year repayment should be hardcoded.

Error Fix: Replace formula =+D7 with hardcoded value -5

Error Cell(s): Debt Schedule, D8 through G8

Error Type: Formula exclusion error

Error Explanation: The closing balance cells are hardcoded values instead of being calculated as Opening Balance + Additions - Repayments. This breaks the debt schedule flow.

Error Fix: Replace hardcoded values with formulas: D8 should be =D5+D6+D7, E8 should be =E5+E6+E7, F8 should be =F5+F6+F7, G8 should be =G5+G6+G7

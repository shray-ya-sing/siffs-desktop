Error Cell(s): Balance Sheet, H15

Error Type: Formula inclusion error

Error Explanation: The Total Assets formula in H15 uses =+H28 which links to Total Liabilities instead of summing the individual asset components. This creates a circular reference where Total Assets equals Total Liabilities, making the balance sheet check meaningless.

Error Fix: Change formula to =+H8+H11+H12+H13+H9 to properly sum all asset components (Fixed Assets + Accounts Receivables + Inventory + Cash + Other Assets if applicable)

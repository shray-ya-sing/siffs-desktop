Error Cell(s): DCF, C30

Error Type: Incorrect Cell Reference

Error Explanation: The terminal value formula references C26 (WACC) instead of C27 (PGR) for the perpetual growth rate in the denominator. The formula should use the perpetual growth rate (PGR) from C27, not the WACC from C26.

Error Fix: Change formula from =(M20*(1+C26))/(C26-C27) to =(M20*(1+C27))/(C26-C27)

Error Cell(s): LBO Modelling, I21

Error Type: Formula Omission Error

Error Explanation: The cash utilization calculation appears to be hardcoded at -125.7207114494953 instead of being calculated from the actual debt repayments. This should be linked to the sum of senior debt and subordinated debt repayments in year 2018.

Error Fix: Replace hardcoded value with formula =I20+I31 or similar calculation linking to actual repayment amounts

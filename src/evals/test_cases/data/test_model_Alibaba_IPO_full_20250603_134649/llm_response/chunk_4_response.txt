Error Cell(s): Index, C95

Error Type: Sign error

Error Explanation: The effective tax rate calculation uses a negative sign in the formula =-C34/C33, but tax expense (C34) should already be negative, making the effective tax rate calculation incorrect. The formula should be =C34/C33 to properly calculate the effective tax rate as a positive percentage.

Error Fix: Change formula from =-C34/C33 to =C34/C33

Error Cell(s): Index, D95, E95, F95, G95

Error Type: Sign error

Error Explanation: The effective tax rate calculations in these cells use negative signs (=-D34/D33, =-E34/E33, etc.) which creates incorrect tax rate calculations. Tax expense should be divided by pre-tax income without the negative sign to get the proper effective tax rate.

Error Fix: Remove the negative signs from the formulas: =D34/D33, =E34/E33, =F34/F33, =G34/G33

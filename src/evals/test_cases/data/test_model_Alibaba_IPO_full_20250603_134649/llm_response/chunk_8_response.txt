Error Cell(s): Dep Capex, E8

Error Type: Sign error

Error Explanation: The formula calculates capital expenditures as a percentage of net sales with a negative sign (=-E7/E6), but capital expenditures should be positive values when expressed as a percentage of sales. The negative sign is incorrect since both E7 (capital expenditures) and E6 (net sales) are positive values.

Error Fix: Change formula from =-E7/E6 to =E7/E6

Error Cell(s): Dep Capex, F8, G8

Error Type: Sign error

Error Explanation: Same issue as E8 - the formulas =-F7/F6 and =-G7/G6 incorrectly apply negative signs when calculating capital expenditures as a percentage of net sales. Both the numerator and denominator are positive, so the result should be positive.

Error Fix: Change formulas from =-F7/F6 to =F7/F6 and from =-G7/G6 to =G7/G6

Error Cell(s): BS, G59

Error Type: Formula inclusion error

Error Explanation: The total equity calculation in cell G59 includes an unexplained hardcoded addition of 6836 (=SUM(G57:G58)+6836) that is not present in other years' formulas. This breaks the standard equity calculation pattern and appears to be an arbitrary adjustment.

Error Fix: Change formula to =SUM(G57:G58) to match the consistent pattern used in other periods.

Error Cell(s): CF, G6

Error Type: Formula inclusion error  

Error Explanation: The net income calculation includes a hardcoded addition of 6836 (=17742+6836) instead of linking to the income statement like other periods. This creates an inconsistent calculation method and the 6836 appears to be the same arbitrary adjustment found in the balance sheet.

Error Fix: Change formula to =IS!G42 to consistently link to the income statement like other forecast periods.

Error Cell(s): IS, O12

Error Type: Formula exclusion error

Error Explanation: The total revenue calculation in cell O12 excludes the "Others" revenue segment (O11). The formula =SUM(O8:O10) only includes China commerce, International commerce, and Cloud computing segments, but should include all four revenue segments through O11.

Error Fix: Change formula from =SUM(O8:O10) to =SUM(O8:O11)

Error Cell(s): IS, O30

Error Type: Sign error

Error Explanation: Interest expense in cell O30 shows a positive value (344.2635) when it should be negative. The formula =Debt!O36 should include a negative sign since interest expense reduces income.

Error Fix: Change formula from =Debt!O36 to =-Debt!O36

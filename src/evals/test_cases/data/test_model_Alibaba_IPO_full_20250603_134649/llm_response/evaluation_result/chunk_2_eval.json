  "score": 0.4,
  "reasoning": "The model response captured errors in cells O12 and O30, but it missed several other errors listed in the golden answer. Specifically, it did not identify the errors in cells J73:J76, O15, O27, and O36. The model response also provided different error types and explanations for the captured errors, which does not affect the score but indicates that it did not fully align with the golden answer. Therefore, it only captured 2 out of the 6 errors.",

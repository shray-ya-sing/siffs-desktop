  "reasoning": "The model response correctly identified the error in cell E8 and provided the correct explanation and fix. It also captured the errors in cells F8 and G8, but it failed to mention that the error in G8 was specifically due to the incorrect negative sign in the formula, which was a key part of the golden answer. The model response did not explicitly state the error for G8 as clearly as it did for E8 and F8, which affects the completeness of the response.",

  "reasoning": "The model response accurately captured the errors in cells H58, I59, J60, K61, L62, M63, N64, O65, and H75, I76, J77, K78, L79, M80, N81, O82. However, it did not mention the specific issue of the inconsistent depreciation pattern for the 3-year useful life assets in the explanation for H58, which is a critical part of the golden answer. Additionally, the model response referred to the error type as 'Formula inclusion error' instead of 'Mathematical Formula Error', which is a deviation from the golden answer but does not affect the capturing of the errors themselves. Overall, it captured most of the errors but missed the complete explanation for H58.",

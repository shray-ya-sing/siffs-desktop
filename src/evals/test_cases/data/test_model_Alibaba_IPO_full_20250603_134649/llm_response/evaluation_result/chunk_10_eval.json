  "reasoning": "The model response accurately captured all the errors identified in the golden answer, including the error cells (H28, H32, H42), the correct error explanations, and the suggested fixes for the formulas. Although the model used a different error type ('Incorrect Cell References' instead of 'Formula inclusion error'), it still correctly identified the issues and provided appropriate corrections. Therefore, it deserves a score of 1.0.",

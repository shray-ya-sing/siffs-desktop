Error Cell(s): Dep Capex, E8

Error Type: Sign error

Error Explanation: The formula "=-E7/E6" has an incorrect negative sign. Capital expenditures as a percentage of net sales should be calculated as a positive ratio (E7/E6), not negative. The E7 values are already negative (representing cash outflows), so adding another negative sign makes the percentage incorrectly positive when it should show the actual relationship.

Error Fix: Change formula from "=-E7/E6" to "=E7/E6"

Error Type: Sign error

Error Explanation: The formula "=-F7/F6" has an incorrect negative sign. Capital expenditures as a percentage of net sales should be calculated as a positive ratio (F7/F6), not negative.

Error Cell(s): Dep Capex, G8

Error Type: Sign error

Error Explanation: The formula "=-G7/G6" has an incorrect negative sign. Capital expenditures as a percentage of net sales should be calculated as a positive ratio (G7/G6), not negative. The G7 values are already negative (representing cash outflows), so adding another negative sign makes the percentage incorrectly positive when it should show the actual relationship.

Error Fix: Change formula from "=-G7/G6" to "=G7/G6"

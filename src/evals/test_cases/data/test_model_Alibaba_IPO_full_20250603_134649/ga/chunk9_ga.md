**Error Cell(s):** Dep Capex, H58

**Error Type:** Mathematical Formula Error

**Error Explanation:** The first-year depreciation calculation uses half-year convention (=$C58/$D58/2) but this creates an inconsistent depreciation pattern. The asset has a 3-year useful life, so using half-year convention in the first year means the asset should depreciate over 4 periods (0.5 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 years), but the current formula only provides 3.5 years of total depreciation.

**Error Fix:** Either use full-year depreciation (=$C58/$D58) for consistency with the 3-year life, or extend the depreciation schedule to include a fourth year with half-year depreciation.

**Error Type:** Mathematical Formula Error  

**Error Explanation:** These cells use half-year convention for the first year of each asset vintage (highlighted in yellow), but then switch to full-year depreciation. This creates inconsistent depreciation patterns where some assets get 3.5 years of depreciation while others get different amounts.

**Error Fix:** Apply consistent depreciation methodology - either use straight-line over 3 years without half-year convention, or properly implement half-year convention with 4-period depreciation schedules.

**Error Type:** Mathematical Formula Error

**Error Explanation:** Same half-year convention inconsistency exists in the Buildings section. The 3-year useful life assets use half-year convention in their first year but don't have corresponding half-year depreciation in a fourth year.

**Error Fix:** Implement consistent depreciation methodology across all asset categories, ensuring total depreciation equals the asset cost over the intended useful life period.Analysis complete.

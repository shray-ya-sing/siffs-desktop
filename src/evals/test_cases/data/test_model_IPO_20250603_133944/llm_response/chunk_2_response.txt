I cannot identify any errors in this portion of the Excel model. The data shown appears to be formatting information for rows 82-100 of the Quarterly IS sheet, but without cell values, formulas, or row/column headers, there are no calculation errors to detect. The formatting appears consistent with financial modeling standards, showing alternating number formats (#,##0) and percentage formats (0.0%) which is typical for financial statements with absolute values and corresponding margin calculations.
Analysis complete.

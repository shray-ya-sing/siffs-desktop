Error Cell(s): Sheet1, C23

Error Type: Formula omission

Error Explanation: The formula for Inventory & Other % COGS in C23 is missing. The cell shows no value and no formula, while D23 and E23 contain the expected calculation using SUM(D58:D59) and SUM(E58:E59) respectively. This creates an incomplete data series for the average calculation in F23.

Error Fix: Add formula =-C79/SUM(C58:C59) to calculate 2019 Inventory & Other as percentage of COGS

Error Cell(s): Sheet1, C24

Error Type: Formula omission

Error Explanation: The formula for Op. Lease Assets % OpEx in C24 is missing. The cell shows no value and no formula, while D24 and E24 contain the expected calculation (=-D81/D60 and =-E81/E60 respectively). This creates an incomplete data series for the average calculation in F24.

Error Cell(s): Sheet1, C27

Error Type: Formula omission

Error Explanation: The formula for Accrued Liabilities % Total Expenses in C27 is missing. The cell shows no value and no formula, while D27 and E27 contain the expected calculation using SUM of total expenses. This creates an incomplete data series for the average calculation in F27.

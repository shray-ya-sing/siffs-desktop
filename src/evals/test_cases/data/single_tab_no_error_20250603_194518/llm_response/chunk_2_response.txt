Error Cell(s): Sheet1, F79

Error Type: Formula inclusion error

Error Explanation: The formula "=-SUM(F58:F59)*F23" includes a negative sign that makes the calculation incorrect. Since this appears to be calculating Inventory & Other assets based on revenue multiples, the formula should be positive. The negative sign would incorrectly reduce the asset value when it should increase it based on the revenue relationship.

Error Fix: Change formula from "=-SUM(F58:F59)*F23" to "=SUM(F58:F59)*F23"

Error Cell(s): Sheet1, G79 through J79

Error Type: Formula inclusion error

Error Explanation: Similar to F79, these cells contain formulas with incorrect negative signs ("=-SUM(G58:G59)*G23", "=-SUM(H58:H59)*H23", etc.) for calculating Inventory & Other assets. The negative signs would incorrectly reduce asset values when they should be positive calculations based on revenue relationships.

Error Fix: Remove the negative signs from all formulas in this range, changing them from "=-SUM(...)*..." to "=SUM(...)*..."

# Cache Management Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The reported bug was that when files were moved from one folder to another (e.g., from `task_excel_folder/mine/` to `task_excel_folder/thgerte/`), the old cache entries remained in `files_mappings.json`, causing duplicate entries for the same filename in different paths.

**Example of the problem:**
```json
{
  "task_excel_folder/mine/Power-Up Builders - Financial Model.xlsx": "C:\\Users\\shrey\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmp_Power-Up Builders - Financial Model_6rhtwsxo.xlsx",
  "task_excel_folder/thgerte/Power-Up Builders - Financial Model.xlsx": "C:\\Users\\shrey\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmp_Power-Up Builders - Financial Model_rza7mhcn.xlsx"
}
```

## Root Cause
The original cache management system only added new entries but never cleaned up old ones when files with the same name were uploaded to different locations. This caused the cache to accumulate stale entries over time.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Cache Manager Logic
Updated the `CacheManager.update_file_mapping()` method to:
- **Detect duplicate filenames** in different directories
- **Automatically remove old entries** when new files with the same name are uploaded
- **Clean up associated metadata cache** for removed entries

### 2. Key Fix in `cache_manager.py`
```python
def update_file_mapping(self, original_path: str, temp_path: str, cleanup_old: bool = True):
    """Update file mappings and optionally cleanup old entries"""
    # Load current mappings
    mappings = self.load_file_mappings()
    
    if cleanup_old:
        # First, cleanup stale mappings (files that no longer exist)
        stale_paths = self.cleanup_stale_mappings()
        if stale_paths:
            self.cleanup_stale_metadata_cache(stale_paths)
        
        # Reload mappings after cleanup
        mappings = self.load_file_mappings()
        
        # Check for same filename in different directories
        original_filename = os.path.basename(original_path)
        paths_to_remove = []
        
        for existing_path in mappings.keys():
            if existing_path != original_path:
                existing_filename = os.path.basename(existing_path)
                if existing_filename == original_filename:
                    # Same filename, remove old mapping
                    paths_to_remove.append(existing_path)
                    logger.info(f"Removing old mapping for same filename: {existing_path}")
        
        # Remove old mappings for the same filename
        for path_to_remove in paths_to_remove:
            if path_to_remove in mappings:
                del mappings[path_to_remove]
                # Also clean up the metadata cache
                self.cleanup_stale_metadata_cache([path_to_remove])
    
    # Update with new mapping
    mappings[original_path] = temp_path
    
    # Save updated mappings
    self.save_file_mappings(mappings)
```

### 3. New API Endpoints
Added a new endpoint to handle cleanup of duplicate filenames:
- `POST /cleanup-duplicate-filenames` - Specifically targets duplicate filename cleanup

### 4. Verification Tests
Created comprehensive tests to verify the fix:
- **Scenario Test**: Simulates exact user workflow of moving files
- **Verification Test**: Recreates the reported issue and confirms resolution

## Test Results

### Before Fix
```json
{
  "task_excel_folder/mine/Power-Up Builders - Financial Model.xlsx": "temp1.xlsx",
  "task_excel_folder/thgerte/Power-Up Builders - Financial Model.xlsx": "temp2.xlsx"
}
```
**Result**: 2 entries (❌ Bug present)

### After Fix
```json
{
  "task_excel_folder/thgerte/Power-Up Builders - Financial Model.xlsx": "temp2.xlsx"
}
```
**Result**: 1 entry (✅ Bug fixed)

## How the Fix Works

1. **Automatic Cleanup**: When a new file is uploaded, the system checks for existing entries with the same filename
2. **Intelligent Removal**: Old entries with the same filename are automatically removed
3. **Metadata Cleanup**: Associated metadata cache files are also cleaned up
4. **Stale Detection**: Files that no longer exist in the filesystem are removed

## Benefits

- ✅ **Eliminates duplicate entries** for the same filename in different folders
- ✅ **Automatic cleanup** requires no manual intervention
- ✅ **Maintains cache integrity** by removing stale entries
- ✅ **Improves performance** by reducing cache size
- ✅ **Prevents LLM confusion** by ensuring accurate file listings

## Usage

The fix is automatically applied when files are uploaded through the normal workflow. No additional configuration is required.

### Manual Cleanup (if needed)
```bash
# Clean up duplicate filenames
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/cleanup-duplicate-filenames

# General cache cleanup
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/cleanup-cache

# Get cache statistics
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/cache-stats
```

## Verification
The fix has been thoroughly tested and verified to resolve the reported issue. Users can now move files between folders without accumulating stale cache entries.
